# Awesome Log

Awesome Log provides a lean wrapper around the default logging utility built into Android.

Your log statement is prefaced by `[ thread name: file name: line number: method name ] --> `.

## Usage

    import io.github.shaobin0604.awesomelog.Log;

    Log.v("Logging a verbose message...");

Will output something like this in logcat:

    D/AwesomeLogï¹• [ main: MainActivity.java: 17: onCreate ] --> Logging a verbose message...

Each of the verbosity levels from the default Log apply here:

- `Log.v(...)`
- `Log.d(...)`
- `Log.i(...)`
- `Log.w(...)`
- `Log.e(...)`


### Set log level

    Log.setLevel(android.util.Log.VERBOSE); // should be one of VERBOSE/DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR

### Set log tag

    Log.setTag("{The global Log TAG}")
